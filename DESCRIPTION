Description: Allowing the simple and quick quantification of copy number signatures in 
    cancer samples from copy number profiles.  The signatures are a readout of mutational 
    processes resulting in chromosomal instability (CIN). It is thought as a one-stop 
    solution, combining multiple published solutions. At the moment the methods from 
    Drews et al. (Nature, 2022) and Macintyre et al. (Nature Genetics, 2018) are included.
