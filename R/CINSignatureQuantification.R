#' CINSignatureQuantification
#' @description Allowing the simple and quick quantification of copy number signatures in
#' cancer samples from copy number profiles. The signatures are a readout of mutational
#' processes resulting in chromosomal instability (CIN). It is thought as a one-stop
#' solution, combining multiple published solutions. At the moment the methods from
#' Drews et al. (Nature, 2022) and Macintyre et al. (Nature Genetics, 2018) are included.
