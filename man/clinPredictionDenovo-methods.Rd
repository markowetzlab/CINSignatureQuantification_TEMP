\usage{
clinPredictionDenovo(object, sampTrain, sigsTrain)

\S4method{clinPredictionDenovo}{SigQuant}(object, sampTrain, sigsTrain)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{SigQuant object}

\item{sampTrain}{Vector of sample names that should be used for training the classifier.}

\item{sigsTrain}{Vector with two signature names on which the prediction should be based upon.}
}
\value{
A vector with "Signature <1> higher" or "Signature <2> higher" for all samples in the input object.
}
\description{
The function takes signature activities based on Drews et al. methodology and predicts patient's response based on
user-specified pair of signatures. \cr \cr
The user should supply a vector of samples for training purposes. The function then trains the classifier on these samples before applying it to all samples and return the labels.
